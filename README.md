# UPDATE: This project is no longer maintained!
I wrote this module back before any module like it existed. It was very rough around the edges, as I had not written a HomeBridge module at all. Eventually somebody else wrote and published a similar, better module, which I began using as I wished to no longer maintain this module. Since then I have switched to using Home Assistant instead of HomeBridge, so I have no reason for this module to exist.
